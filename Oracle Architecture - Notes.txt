Oracle database architecture 

- An instance is a combination of SGA and PGA.
- In an instance there is only one SGA but there can be two
  or more PGA's. 
- Abrupt shutdown of any mandatory process results in the 
  shutdown of the instance. 
- Dnnn = Dispatcher processes - nnn are numeric digits max 999 can be processes
- Snnn = Shared Server processe - """"""
- Arcn = Archiver process
- RECO = Recover process
- VKRM = Virtual Scheduler for Resource Manager - It manages the cpu scheduling for all managed oracle processes.
- RCBG = Result Cache Background Process - It is use to handle invalidation and other messages generated by server processes attached to other instances in rac. 
- MMAN = Memory Manager - this process performs the resizing of memory components of the instance and serves as instance manager and memory broker. 
- MMON = Memory Monitor or Manageability Monitor - it performs many tasks related to manageability including taking automatic workload repository snapshots and performing automatic database diagnostics monitor analysis.  
- MMNL = Manageability Monitor Lightweight process - It peforms tasks including Active Session History capture and metrics computation. 
- PMON = Process Monitory - Performs periodical cleanup of the processes which died abnormally in sessions (detach network connnections, detach transactions beyond provided time etc.) 21:00 
- SMON = System Monitor or Service Monitor - It performs many database maintenance tasks including creating and managing the temporary space metadata, maintains the undo tablespace, shrinking undo tablespace based on usage, maintains the scn to time mapping table, cleans up data dictionary if it is inconsistent, smon of one instance can perform instance recover of other instance.         
- RECO = Recoverer process - 
- DBRM = Database Resource Manager - this process sets resource plan and other tasks related to database resource manager. 
- EMNC = Emon Coordinator PRocess - Performs Event management and notification activity in the database including strings event notification, continuous query notifcations, fast application notification. 
- GEN0 = Generic Task Execution - performs general task on behalf of other background process to offload some potential blocking tasks.
- VKTM = Virtual Keeper of Time - it acts as a time publisher for an oracle instance. two sets of time, wall clock time using seconds interval and higher resolution time. Centralises time tracking and offload multiple timer calls from other clients.
- PSP0 = Process Sponsor. 
- AQPC = Advance Que Process Coordinator - responsible for performing administrative activities
- QMMN = Advance Que Master Class
